h4. Selenium2 (selenium-webdriver) vs Watir

Next major version of Selenum2 (also known as webdriver) is still in Beta, it is supported in multiple programming languages. Here we only compares its Ruby version (a popular and concise scripting language, perfect for test scripts) against Watir (Web application testing in Ruby) 

Verdict: Watir

h4. RWebSpec vs Watir vs Selenium2

RWebSpec provides an high level abstract of testing syntax on top of Watir or Selenium2, i.e., if you develop test in RWebSpec, it will be easy to switch between Watir and Selenium2. Besides, with of loss of flexibility, you can use native Watir with RWebSpec or Selenium2 with RWebSpec.

Also RWebSpec provides other benefits
